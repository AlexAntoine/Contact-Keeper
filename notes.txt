Fixed update feature issue. I didn't add the 
middleware that had the user id.

useContext hook is not working
I think useContext is working now 

Form is not working
useContext is not working now

tried cloning this on my mac. I had to instal react-scripts 
for some reason and now there are a whole host of issues.
FML!!

react-scripts seems to be working now. Still having issues
with useContext hook.

Figured out form issue:
I tried to write this
<input type='radio' name="type" value="personal" checked={type === 'personal'}/>personal{' '}

like this
<input type='radio' name="type" value="personal" checked={type === 'personal'}>personal{' '}</input>

The form is working and so is the add contact function

added set and clear contact function
